## [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) Backend

- [SQLAlchemy](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_1_1/) ORM with [Flask-SQLAlchemy](http://flask-sqlalchemy.pocoo.org/2.2/) and migrations provided by [Flask-Alembic](https://flask-alembic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- RESTful APIs provided by a customized integration between [Flask-RESTful](http://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Flask-Marshmallow](http://flask-marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [Flask-Security](https://flask-security.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) provides authentication, authorization, registration and change/forgot password functionality
   - User session management via [Flask-Login](https://flask-login.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
   - User permissions and roles via [Flask-Principal](https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Principal/)
   - Secrets encryption via [passlib](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [itsdangerous](https://pythonhosted.org/itsdangerous/)
   - CSRF protection via [Flask-WTF](https://flask-wtf.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [Flask-Admin](https://flask-admin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) integrated for painless model CRUD administration
- [Flask-Session](http://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Session/) for server-side sessions
- [Celery](http://www.celeryproject.org/) for asynchronous tasks, such as sending emails via [Flask-Mail](https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Mail/)

The backend is structured using the [Application Factory Pattern](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/patterns/appfactories/), in conjunction with a little bit of declarative configuration in `backend/config.py` (for ordered registration of extensions, and auto-detection of views, models, serializers, model admins and cli commands). The entry point is the `create_app()` method in `backend/app.py` (`wsgi.py` in production).


## [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) Frontend

The frontend is bult with React and Redux

- [React Router v4](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web)
- [Redux](http://redux.js.org/), [Redux-Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/) and [Redux-Form](https://redux-form.com) for handling state and side effects
- [Webpack 3](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Babel 6](https://babeljs.io/)
   - Hot Module Reloading
   - Tree Shaking
   - Code Splitting (asynchronous components via [react-loadable](https://github.com/thejameskyle/react-loadable))

Entry point is at `frontend/index.jsx`.
